# rock_pool_bioblitz
The purpose of this project is to produce an infographic of rocky shore species presence data collected by citizen scientists during The Rock Pool Project 2025 iNaturalist Bioblitz.

The infographic below displays the number of non-terrestrial records that were identified to species level, grouped into native and non-native species, across taxonomic ranks (Kingdom, Phylum and Class) using bar plots.

The bar plots use the data listed below:

* iNaturalist bioblitz 2025 data - accessed via API
* World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) taxonomic data - accessed via API
* List of UK non-native marine species - locally stored ("Data/UK marine NNS.csv")
